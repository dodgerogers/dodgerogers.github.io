You've pored over the instructional section in every golf magazine, worked hard on your swing in the living room, and you’re ready for 18 holes this weekend with your buddies. But standing on the 10th tee, five shots over your handicap, it seems like everyone has an opinion on what exactly is going wrong. Ninety blows later and no matter what you tried, PGA Tour glory seems farther away than ever.

The authenticity of your buddies' tips are always under question, and these remarks and quick fixes rarely hit the mark. Want to get your golfing mojo back? Throw away the magazines, stop listening to your mates, and take control of your game by understanding the physics behind your shots. Quick fixes and clichés simply don't cut it anymore.

For simplicity’s sake, let’s set the record straight on one important matter; the face angle at impact is the main factor in determining your shot’s starting line and your golfing gratification. If the face is pointing left, the ball starts left. Don't believe us? Test it yourself. Grab a putter, cut across the ball, and keep the face open. Watch as the start line closely corresponds to the face angle at impact rather than the club path–which was the convention eons ago. Looking at both the face angle and club path at impact is key to deciphering the problems with your wayward shots and keeping your PGA Tour dreams alive. 

So how is this going to help me make the cut, you ask? Lets look at a shot that haunts our nightmares. Starting left of the target and curving violently to the right, it’s the dreaded pull-slice. The shot starts left as the face is pointing left at impact, and due to the path of the club pointing further left than the face, the ball curves to the right.

If the face is open relative to the path by 0.5 to 20 degrees, the ball will always curve to the right with some spin. And what if the face is closed relative to the path? You guessed it, the ball curves to the left. It's really that simple.

Fixing the slice has been likened to squaring the circle (a mathematical impossibility), but remove the stigma around the shot and the solution is fundamentally simple. First, check your starting line. If it's anything other than straight down the center, check your clubface at setup. Tweak the face open a couple of degrees if the ball is starting left. You might be tempted to close the face at setup if the ball is starting right, but be warned, it's a slippery slope. Ensure the face is absolutely square and nothing more. Now give it a swing. 

Are your shots starting straighter? Great, you're halfway there. Now you just need the club path pointing further right than the clubface for that PGA Tour power draw.

Here are some common pro-approved moves that you can use to groove that in-to-out swing path:

1. Square the shoulders during the setup position. You'd be surprised at how many of us have our shoulders pointing left at setup. Feel as though they are pointing to the right for more room to attack the ball from the inside. 

2. It’s all in the hips. Initiate the downswing with your hips rotating first, which will drop the club on the inside. 

3. Remember to have rock solid foundation. Maintain a central weight distribution throughout the shot to avoid sliding into the ball with an inconsistent swing path.

Don't get bogged down trying to correct that flying elbow or reverse pivot the next time things start to go south on the links. Simply look at the start line and shape of your shot to reveal everything about your swing and work backwards from there.
