Punctuated by high, weak, and disparaging shots, another routine weekend hack around the golf course can leave you in anguish. If you suffer from such afflictions, here are two modern golfing principles that can change the way you drive the ball.

Spin Loft

Are your approach shots consistently missing the mark? Low compression is a likely culprit. For decades, this axiom has been thrown around the game in an attempt to describe a player’s ball striking ability, based simply on subjective cues. But now in the age of launch monitors, compression has its own unit of measurement and a new name; it’s called spin loft, and is measured in degrees. It determines everything from smash factor, ball speed, spin rate, carry, and total distance, and now we can finally observe and harness it. This is clearly a stat to take note of.

Spin loft is the angle between two vectors: dynamic loft and angle of attack. It ultimately governs the amount of spin on the ball and the “obliqueness” of the strike. Fundamentally, more energy is transferred into propelling the ball forwards with a low angle of spin loft than a high one. It comes as no surprise to hear that top professionals and amateurs produce low figures of spin loft, but surely a few degrees can’t make that much difference, right?

Well, lets take two shots with a driver; we’ll negate shaft flex for simplicity and assume centered contact and a 100 mph club head speed. Shot one’s angle of attack is -5° and the dynamic loft is 15°, while shot two’s angle of attack is +10°, with a dynamic loft of 15°. Common sense suggests that the two shots should launch similarly with such comparable dynamic lofts, but with a 15° difference in spin loft, this isn’t the case. Shot one launches lower, producing higher spin, 20° of spin loft, and a ball speed of 140 mph, while shot two launches higher with less spin, 5° of spin loft and 149 mph ball speed. With an approximate gain of nine mph ball speed, those few degrees really do add up.

Lowering your spin loft is easier said than done, but getting yourself booked on a launch monitor and examining your dynamic loft and angle of attack is a good start. We recommend a fitting center at Roger Dunn from Worldwide Golf Shops. (Link: http://www.worldwidegolfshops.com/wwg-fitting-centers.html ) If nothing else, recognizing these concepts will help you understand the laws of ball flight better than your golfing buddies.

Vertical Gear Effect

Did you just buy a $500 adjustable driver? Are you still hitting it shorter than your friends? We have three words for you: vertical gear effect. No, this isn’t a rock climbing apparatus or the next big gaming release. It’s a phenomenon the golf industry has been taking advantage of ever since we saw the introduction of titanium driver heads, and it truly gives the weekend warrior something for nothing.

Without delving into face curvature and bulge, vertical gear effect is the rotation of the clubface around the center of gravity. When two gears work in unison, one gear travels in one direction and the secondary gear moves in the opposite direction. It’s the same principle when applied horizontally, which causes a hook off the toe and a slice off the heel. Comparably, striking the ball above the center of gravity causes the club to rotate clockwise; due to dynamic loft, our shot will never have topspin, but it will also have drastically less backspin, which means more mph, yards, and bragging rights.

For those with an adjustable driver, faster ball speeds could be just a screw turn away. Lower the center of gravity by adding a few extra grams to the sole of the club and aim for the top inch of the clubface.

So next time you’re out on the course, remember these principles and you’ll be smashing it past your buddies and feeling great about your game. Golf anguish? Not on this tee.
