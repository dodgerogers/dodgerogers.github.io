Three golf gadgets to help you take control of your game As tempting as it may be to spend your hard earned cash on one of the new adjustable drivers or a set of muscle-cavity-blade irons, the fact is whilst these may improve your golfing street credit, the will have little consequence on your game. Here are Teebox’s top 3 golfing gadgets to help you understand your swing mechanics and idiosyncrasies to lower your scores.

**Swingbyte 2**

Whilst advances in club technology can make minor reductions to axis spin and increases in ball speed, the secret to pure golf shots lies in understanding how to apply the club correctly to the ball. Swingbyte 2 clips onto any club and aims to shed light on our own swing mechanics by wirelessly transmitting real-time swing data and interactive 3-D modeling to your iOS or Andriod device. They have made slip-free stability enhancements over the previous Swingbyte unit as well as a major overhaul of their app and online analytics software. 

The device captures critical data on club head speed, angle of attack, face angle relative to path and dynamic loft at impact, which are the keys in fathoming and optimizing your ball flight. The Figures tracked have been verified alongside leading club tracking software to within a couple of degrees when calibrated properly so you can be confident of its aptitude. The ability to record quantifiable, consistent and objective data on what elements of your swing cause poor shots is imperative to becoming a better player. Swingbyte 2 retails at $149.99 + P&P and is available to preorder online at https://www.swingbyte.com/store?product=2

**The Orange Stick Putting Aid**

Out of all the clubs in the bag, none has more consequence on your score than the putter. Whilst it is universally accepted that there is no right or wrong in putting, one thing in common with all the greats is a square face at impact. Doppler radar technology has confirmed that face angle at impact is the overriding factor in determining where the ball starts relative to our target. 

The Orange Stick concentrates solely on this principle and provides instant and gratifying feedback on your face angle at impact. The aid has been designed for holing those problematic three footers, but you can also use it on anything up to twenty feet. 

Place the Orange Stick three feet away from the hole and use the sightlines to align yourself and the putter face square to your target. Poor putts fall off the side immediately outlining any patterns in face angle with good putts sailing straight down the center. At $21.95 + P&P this is the easiest and most inexpensive way to drop 3 shots of your score.

**Bushnell V3 Rangefinder**

Markers and distances found on the course seldom bear any relevance to the actual distance you have to the pin. A back pin position may be as much as thirty yards out from the yardage declared on the scorecard. 

GPS rangefinders give golfers accurate yardages to the center, front and back of the greens, however this often doesn’t tell the full story. Laser range finders offer yardages directly to the pin, but have always been plagued by the operators’ ability to discern whether they had indeed locked onto the target or a palm tree 40 yards over the back.

The latest offering from Bushnell seeks to remedy this. The V3 offers JOLT technology, which eliminates doubt by delivering a short vibrating burst to reinforce the laser has locked onto the flag. Hitting your approach shots pin high is paramount to eliminating 3 putts and lowering your score. The V3 is legal to use in tournament play and retails at $299.99 + P&P with its non-legal V3 Slope counterpart at $399.99 + P&P. To find out more go to http://bushnellgolf.com/laser/tourv3.cfm
