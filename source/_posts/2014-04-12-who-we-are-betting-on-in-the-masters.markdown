We’re coming up to the most iconic spectacle in golf and once again Tiger Woods is making the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Surgery on a pinched nerve in his back has forced him to withdraw from the tournament for the first time since 1994. Having withdrawn once and posting at least three of his highest scores ever this season, seeing him lift the trophy on Sunday would have been less than probable. However, unlike any other player on the PGA Tour, he gets the people going, as well as the advertising revenues – even when he’s on the second page of the leaderboard.

The last time Tiger missed the Masters, the western world went haywire. O.J. Simpson was arrested, the MLB World Series was cancelled, and Kurt Cobain was found dead. Are we heading for a similar set of circumstances this year?

The experts may be getting themselves all worked up regarding Tiger’s absence, but they are forgetting one simple fact. No player is bigger than the Masters itself. Augusta National will always be the star in this show while McIlroy, Mickelson, Day and Bubba adorn the list of potential suitors, and we all know what happens when Phil “turns up.” So the question is, will we see a clansman of the Tour or a millennial sporting the Green Jacket on Sunday?

Omitting Jimmy Walker for his amazing triple win season start, the latest batch of PGA winners have all limped and fumbled over the finishing line, leaving fans deservedly concerned and uninspired about the fate of 2014’s first major. World rankings and national qualifying tournaments play a much larger part in concocting the field for the Masters than regular PGA tournaments, so fret not, the majority of lackadaisical PGA millennials will not be making an appearance on this hallowed turf, leaving the door wide open for one of our old favorites.

Stenson, Mickelson, Day and McIlroy are all odds on favorites, but should we trust the experts? Mickelson is random at best, Stenson has questionable results at Augusta, and Day has just returned after a six week hiatus following wrist surgery. Taking this into consideration, we weigh up our options and share our top three Masters picks.

With two wins and five top 25s in his last 11 starts, Cedar Rapids local Zach Johnson is off to a dominant start. Plotting his way around methodically rather than bludgeoning the course has proven fruitful once before in 2007, plus a win going toe-to-toe against Tiger himself means he won’t be shaking in his cleats coming down the stretch on Sunday. With a 0.264 strokes gained putting stat and ranked 7th overall in scoring average, at 33-1 Zach is at the very least worth an each way bet.

McIlroy may be the bookies’ favorite thanks to his world rankings, but a timid start to the year has left a lot of people scratching their heads. McIlroy’s Masters chances rely on momentum from a solid performance at the Shell Houston Open and whether he can tame the short stick and improve his strokes gained putting statistic. If the planets align, the rain comes down, and his putter heats up, he could potentially overpower and dominate the field at Augusta. At 10-1 the pot won’t be huge, but it’s safe to say he’ll be in the top five.

Glancing over Kuchar’s PGA Tour stats may read like a lecture on Bell’s Normal Distribution curve, but, while he may not rank first in anything, every aspect of his game ranks on average in the top half. It doesn’t sound like the makeup of a champion, but it does mean he has no apparent weaknesses, a powerful attribute at Augusta. With a happy go lucky mindset and a strong showing at both the Valero Texas and Shell Houston Open, this could just be the warmup the Georgia Tech alumni needs at 18-1.
